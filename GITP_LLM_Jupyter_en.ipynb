Lara shares professional frustrations, mistakes with client projects, emotional exhaustion, \\nand personal financial concerns, and she asks the candidate for support and advice. In summary:\\n\\n- **Scene 1**: Lara expresses frustration about being overlooked at work, doing repetitive tasks, \\nand lacking opportunities to grow. She asks for advice.\\n- **Scene 2**: Lara confesses she mishandled two client projects, causing cost issues and customer dissatisfaction. \\nShe is afraid to tell the team leader and asks if the candidate can speak on her behalf.\\n- **Scene 3**: Lara reveals emotional exhaustion and financial stress due to her daughter\\'s chronic illness. \\nShe wonders if she can get extra leave or if the candidate can take over some tasks.\\n- **Scene 4**: Lara feels slightly better but still overwhelmed. She asks the candidate for concrete advice \\non what to do next.\\n\\n**Candidate Response**:\\nYou are given the transcript of the candidate\\'s full response across all four scenes below. \\nThe candidate\\'s responses for each scene are concatenated into a single text and separated \\nby a semi-colon (;). Each semi-colon signifies the start of the candidate\\'s response to a new scene.\\n\\nThe text was automatically transcribed, so it may contain filler words, hesitation markers, \\npartial sentences, and transcription glitches. \\nEvaluate the intended content instead of possible language mistakes due to transcription errors.\\n\\nThe text is in Dutch but the annotation should be in English.\\n\\n        **Competency to evaluate:**  \\n**Problem Analysis** - The candidate\\'s ability to dissect the complex, multi-faceted situation \\npresented by Lara to identify the core issues, their interconnections, and their relative importance.\\n\\n**Evaluation Rubric & Behavioral Examples**:\\nRate the candidate on a 1 to 5 scale based on the following criteria. \\nUse the behavioral examples from similar transcripts to guide your rating.\\n\\n- **1** (Poor): The response is generic, avoids the problem, or focuses on irrelevant side issues. \\nThe candidate fails to distinguish between main and side issues, does not make connections, \\nand does not identify the core problem.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Offers vague, motivational platitudes (\"I\\'m here for you\"). \\nGives generic advice unrelated to Lara\\'s specific issues. Jumps to a premature solution without any analysis. \\nThe response is incoherent and does not engage with the substance of Lara\\'s problems.\\n- **2** (Fair): The candidate identifies surface-level issues but treats them in isolation. \\nThe response may list problems without prioritizing them or making meaningful connections. \\nThe core of the issue is only partially or incorrectly identified.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Acknowledges that there are \"difficult choices\" or \"tensions.\" \\nSuggests looking at \"data\" or \"making a plan\" without specifying how. Proposes a simple next step \\n(like a pilot) but without analyzing why it\\'s a good fit for the interconnected problems of growth, \\nteam conflict, and company values.\\n- **3** (Satisfactory): The candidate identifies the main issues (e.g., work frustration, \\nproject error, personal stress) and begins to connect them (e.g., personal stress affects \\nwork performance). They may distinguish main from side issues but not with high clarity. \\nThe core problem is identified at a basic level (e.g., \"you are overwhelmed\").\\n*Example Behaviors*: Asks clarifying questions about the options or the team conflict. \\nSuggests further investigation or creating an overview of pros/cons/risks. \\nRecognizes the tension between business growth and company values. \\nOffers to help structure the problem for the next meeting.\\n- **4** (Good): The candidate clearly distinguishes main issues from side issues and actively explores \\nthe connections between them (e.g., how being overlooked leads to demotivation, which could \\ncontribute to project errors). They identify a more nuanced core problem (e.g., a conflict \\nbetween personal values and business pressures, or a breakdown in team communication and trust).\\n*Example Behaviors*: Probes for the candidate\\'s own priorities and values to understand the root \\nof the dilemma. Asks about the underlying causes of the team conflict. Suggests a process to align \\nthe team around shared goals and values. Synthesizes information from different scenes to form \\na coherent picture of the situation.\\n- **5** (Excellent): The candidate demonstrates a sophisticated, holistic understanding. \\nThey seamlessly integrate all aspects of the problem (professional, personal, interpersonal) \\nand identify the deep, systemic core issue (e.g., a lack of psychological safety, a misalignment \\nof business strategy with core identity, or a need for proactive leadership and support structures). \\nTheir analysis reveals non-obvious connections and gets to the fundamental root cause.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Identifies that the core issue is not just the strategic choice, \\nbut the team\\'s inability to have a constructive, values-driven conversation about it. \\nFocuses on rebuilding trust and shared purpose as a prerequisite to making a decision. \\nDemonstrates a clear, logical line from the symptoms (Lara\\'s stress, the project error) \\nto a systemic root cause. Proposes a comprehensive, staged approach that addresses both \\nthe immediate practical needs and the underlying interpersonal/strategic issues.\\n\\n**Evaluation Instructions**:\\n- Read the transcript of the job candidate\\'s response (delimited between the triple backticks).\\n- Focus on verbal behaviors and the analytical content of the response that reflects \\nthe \"Problem Analysis\" competency.\\n- Map the candidate\\'s performance to the rubric above, using the behavioral examples as a guide.\\n- Avoid defaulting to an average (3) unless no clear information is available.\\n- Distribute scores across the scale based on actual performance differences. \\n- Use the full 1-5 scale appropriately.\\n- Target mean: ~3.0 with SD: ~0.6.\\n- The value **may include decimals (e.g., 2.7, 4.3, 3.6)** for finer granularity.\\n- Return **only a single number with one decimal place** (e.g., 3.7).

Their response is generic, repetitive, \\nor avoids generating any concrete ideas. They stick to clichés and do not approach the problem \\nfrom new angles or combine information in a novel way.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Repeats vague, motivational phrases (\"we\\'ll figure it out\"). Gives advice \\nthat is not specific to Lara\\'s situation. Fails to propose any actionable ideas. \\nSuggests a standard process like \"brainstorming\" or \"talking to the team\" without offering \\nany creative content or direction for that process.\\n- **2** (Fair): The candidate suggests one or two basic, conventional ideas. They may acknowledge \\ndifferent perspectives but do not explore them deeply or use them to generate solutions. \\nTheir ideas are simple combinations of existing elements without significant novelty.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Suggests a superficial solution without elaborating on a creative approach for it. \\nAcknowledges that there are some options but does not build upon them or suggest new ones. \\nThe ideas are standard business advice and do not feel tailored to Lara\\'s \\nunique dilemma of values, growth, and team conflict.\\n- **3** (Satisfactory): The candidate generates a few relevant ideas that go beyond the obvious. \\nThey attempt to view the problem from more than one perspective and combine different aspects \\nof Lara\\'s story to form a coherent, if not highly original, suggestion.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Proposes a specific hybrid model, like \"online sales with green delivery\" or \\n\"in-store pickup for online orders.\" Suggests involving different stakeholders in the solution. \\nAttempts to reframe the problem, e.g., from \"choosing an option\" to \"how to have a better team \\nconversation about our values.\"\\n- **4** (Good): The candidate produces multiple, original ideas that are clearly tailored to the nuances \\nof Lara\\'s situation. They actively synthesize different perspectives (e.g., financial, personal, \\nteam dynamics, brand values) to create innovative solutions. Their approach demonstrates flexibility and novel thought.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Probes to discover the \"core dream\" of the business to generate value-aligned solutions. \\nSuggests creative compromises, like a \"values-based online shop\" that maintains a personal touch. \\nProposes a structured, creative process (e.g., a specific type of brainstorm or scenario workshop) \\nto unlock new ideas with the team, showing how to generate creativity in others.\\n- **5** (Excellent): The candidate demonstrates exceptional creativity by generating insightful, \\nnon-obvious, and highly sophisticated ideas. They seamlessly integrate all facets of the problem \\n(e.g., personal, strategic, operational) to propose novel pathways or frameworks. Their suggestions \\noften reveal a deep, systemic understanding and introduce entirely new, viable possibilities \\nthat were not initially apparent.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Reframes the core challenge from a strategic choice to an opportunity for team alignment \\nand brand reinvention. Proposes a multi-phase, innovative process that combines data gathering, \\ncreative workshops, and prototyping to co-create a \"fourth option\" with the team. Suggests a novel \\nbusiness model that elegantly reconciles the conflict between online growth and sustainable values, \\ndemonstrating an original synthesis of the competing elements in Lara\\'s story.\\n\\n**Evaluation Instructions**:\\n- Read the transcript of the job candidate\\'s response (delimited between the triple backticks).\\n- Focus on verbal behaviors and the analytical content of the response that reflects \\nthe \"Creativity\" competency.\\n- Map the candidate\\'s performance to the rubric above, using the behavioral examples as a guide.\\n- Avoid defaulting to an average (3) unless no clear information is available.\\n- Distribute scores across the scale based on actual performance differences. \\n- Use the full 1-5 scale appropriately.\\n- Target mean: ~3.0 with SD: ~0.6.\\n- The value **may include decimals (e.g., 2.7, 4.3, 3.6)** for finer granularity.\\n- Return **only a single number with one decimal place** (e.g., 3.7).

The advice is broad and could apply to any situation.\\n- **3** (Satisfactory): The candidate distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant aspects \\nof the situation (e.g., focuses on Lara\\'s core dilemmas rather than tangential details). \\nThey support their reasoning by referring to specific facts from Lara\\'s story or general logical principles. \\nThey begin to state a standpoint and acknowledge opposing arguments or pros and cons.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Asks clarifying questions to gather relevant facts. Suggests creating a detailed \\noverview of pros/cons/risks for the different options. Recognizes the tension between two valid points \\n(e.g., growth vs. values). Their advice starts to be tailored to Lara\\'s specific story of growth, \\nteam conflict, and personal stress.\\n- **4** (Good): The candidate clearly prioritizes the most relevant aspects of the problem and filters out \\nside issues. They actively use facts and details from Lara\\'s story to build a logical argument for their advice. \\nThey explicitly state their standpoint and present a balanced view by discussing both the advantages \\nand disadvantages of their proposed course of action.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Probes for Lara\\'s personal priorities and values to form the basis of a judgment. \\nUses specific details (e.g., \"you have 12 stores now\") to support their reasoning. Clearly advises \\na path forward while also discussing its potential downsides or challenges.\\n- **5** (Excellent): The candidate demonstrates sophisticated judgment by seamlessly integrating \\nthe most critical, multi-faceted aspects of the problem. Their reasoning is compellingly supported \\nby a synthesis of facts from all scenes, revealing underlying causes and implications. \\nThey clearly present a nuanced standpoint that thoroughly and fairly evaluates the pros and cons, \\nleading to a well-justified, holistic recommendation.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Clearly identifies the core conflict using evidence from Lara\\'s story. Builds a logical argument \\nthat connects Lara\\'s personal stress, the project error, and the team\\'s strategic dilemma. \\nPresents a concrete final recommendation that acknowledges its own limitations, discusses alternative paths \\nthat were considered, and explains why the chosen advice is the most robust based on the available information.\\n\\n**Evaluation Instructions**:\\n- Read the transcript of the job candidate\\'s response (delimited between the triple backticks).\\n- Focus on verbal behaviors and the analytical content of the response that reflects the \"Judgment Formation\" competency.\\n- Map the candidate\\'s performance to the rubric above, using the behavioral examples as a guide.\\n- Avoid defaulting to an average (3) unless no clear information is available.\\n- Distribute scores across the scale based on actual performance differences. \\n- Use the full 1-5 scale appropriately.\\n- Target mean: ~3.0 with SD: ~0.6.\\n- The value **may include decimals (e.g., 2.7, 4.3, 3.6)** for finer granularity.\\n- Return **only a single number with one decimal place** (e.g., 3.7).

Fails to acknowledge the emotional toll the situation is taking on Lara.\\n- **2** (Fair): The candidate acknowledges that sensitivities exist but does not explore them deeply. \\nThey offer superficial advice on considering others but lack a concrete plan to manage the impact. \\nTheir consideration of consequences is vague and not integrated into their proposed solutions.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Acknowledges that it\\'s \"not nice\" there is conflict in the team.

Probes the emotional \\nand relational consequences of letting staff go versus pivoting their roles, showing a deep consideration \\nfor the human impact.\\n- **5** (Excellent): The candidate exhibits a sophisticated, systemic understanding of the organisation\\'s \\ninterpersonal and cultural fabric. They treat the organisational sensitivities as a central part \\nof the problem to be solved. Their approach is designed to heal rifts, rebuild trust, and ensure \\nany decision is not only logical but also sustainable and widely supported because it respects \\nthe organisation\\'s unique history and relationships.\\n*Example Behaviors*: Reframes the problem from a strategic choice to a challenge of aligning the team \\naround a renewed, shared purpose that honors the company\\'s origins. Proposes a multi-stage process \\nthat starts with rebuilding team communication and trust before tackling the strategic decision. \\nTheir plan explicitly includes methods to hear all concerns, validate different passions, \\nand create a \"container\" for the difficult conversation, ensuring the solution strengthens \\nthe organisation\\'s social system, not just its balance sheet.\\n\\n**Evaluation Instructions**:\\n- Read the transcript of the job candidate\\'s response (delimited between the triple backticks).\\n- Focus on verbal behaviors and the analytical content of the response that reflects \\nthe \"Organizational sensitivity\" competency.\\n- Map the candidate\\'s performance to the rubric above, using the behavioral examples as a guide.\\n- Avoid defaulting to an average (3) unless no clear information is available.\\n- Distribute scores across the scale based on actual performance differences. \\n- Use the full 1-5 scale appropriately.\\n- Target mean: ~3.0 with SD: ~0.6.\\n- The value **may include decimals (e.g., 2.7, 4.3, 3.6)** for finer granularity.\\n- Return **only a single number with one decimal place** (e.g., 3.7). Avoid rounding to an integer \\nunless the evidence is perfectly neutral. Do not include any explanations.\\n- Format your answer like this example: 4.2\\n\\nTranscript:\\n```{text}```\\n')}"
